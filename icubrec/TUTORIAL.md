# Tutorial - Training a speech recognition system for WSJ dataset

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will see how to train and test a DNN-based model for WSJ.
The main steps to do so are:
* train a GMM-HMM model
* compute the alignments for the training data using the GMM-HMM model
* train a DNN model to perform phoneme recognition using these alignments
* test the DNN-HMM system offline


We will now go through each step in detail

## Training the GMM-HMM model

## Computing alignments

## Training the DNN model

### Option 1: with HTK

### Option 2: with Tensorflow

## Test the system
